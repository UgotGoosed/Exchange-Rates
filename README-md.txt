# Project Title

This project I needed to create an application that converted US Dollars to the
Canadian Currency. There will be 2 text fields, 2 lables and a button to convert
currencies.

## Analysis Steps

To come to this solution, I need to create 2 text fields with labels.
I had to create a button that will convert the us dollars text field
to the canadian currency text field.
I had to create a method that would calculate the currency exchange rate of US
to canadian currency and an event handler to handle the event of clicking the button.

### Design

I created an HBox with 2 labels with text fields attached to them.
the HBox also has a button with text on the button.
I then put the HBox in the scene.

### Testing

Pretty simple set up and testing. I created the scene with the two text fields
and button. Then I ran the program to see if they were set how I wanted them to be.
After they looked how I wanted them to, I set up a method to make the exchange rate.
I used an event handler to run the method when I clicked the button. 
Worked well.
